# Porky's Portable Pitstop

A simple landing page for Porky's Portable Pitstop, a mobile mechanic business. I created this project to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while having fun designing a mock website for a future business my fianc√© and I are planning to launch.

## Features
- Responsive design
- Contact form
- Mechanic's Tip of the Day

## Why I Chose This Project
I wanted to build a project that felt meaningful and practical. This page is a starting point for what could eventually become a real website for our mobile mechanic business.
